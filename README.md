# Project 3 - Informative/Educational Project

Accept the assignment using the link in Canvas and complete the steps below from within VS Code (using the GitHub Classroom extension).  
  
For this project, you will be creating a single page application with 3–5 components. These components can take the form of different pages/views or exist as multiple components in a single page/view (or some combination of both). The project should feature significant user interaction and inform or educate the user on a topic that is relevant to your field of study or interests/passions.  
  
Reminder: "single page" means that everything should happen in one index.html document (similar to Assignment 4 and Project 1). All components should either be visible on initial load or dynamically shown/hidden using controls. The specific method for navigating these sections is up to you.  
  
The site should include the following elements:
- A header with the project title
- Responsive layout (desktop & mobile)
- 3-5 components, at least 2 of which are interactive (e.g. nav bar, photo gallery, embedded media players, etc) 
- A footer with your name and copyright year
- Appropriate use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any optional libraries (e.g. p5, Bootstrap, etc) - everything should be coded using the techniques and conventions discussed in class and work as expected

Some random project ideas:
- An emroidery tutorial including step-by-step instructions with a photo gallery
- An interactive map of favorite study locations around campus including photos and descriptions
- A tour of the solar system with animated orbiting planets

**General grading criteria:**
- Interactive/reactive/generative elements — 25 points
